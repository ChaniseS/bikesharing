# NYC Citibike Analysis
## Citibike Overview
There is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, we have prepared visualizations that will show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Analysis
- The "Checkout Times by Users" visual shows that Riders typically only use the Citibikes for 'quick trips' rather than for long journeys. The Most Riders (146,752) used the bike for 5 Minutes while the least amount of riders (33) used the bikes for 2 Hours and 59 Minutes.

- The "Checkout Times by Gender"visual shows that Females are the most popular riders by an overwhelming amount over Males. Although Females utilize the Citibikes the most, the data still proves that the bikes are not used for long trips. Majority of Female riders use the Citibikes for approx 5 Minutes while the Male riders use the Citibikes for approx 6 Minutes.

- This visual for the "Trips by Weekday per Hour" clealy shows that the time between 12AM - 5AM should be considered 'Dead Hours' for the Citibike usage. However, the rest of the times vary by day. During the week, the Citibike usage is pretty consistant with the nornal work hours. 6AM - 9AM are normal travel times TO work, which is when the Travel time increases and then decreases when riders head into work, then picks back up after work hours.

- The visual for the "Trips by Weekday per Hour by Gender" is very interesting. Although we aleady saw in the "Checkout times by Gender" that Females are the most consistant users of the Citibike. this data overwhelmingly proves that Females are more keen to riding the Citibikes than Males. Are Males walking or taking Public Transportation?

- The 'User Trips by Gender" very clearly shows that Riders who have subscriptions are very active among the Female and Male riders - actually everyday.  Although the numbers are super low compared to the subscribers, the count of riders who do not have a subscription are pretty significant. Significant enought that maybe there should be some type of promotion for those who do not have a subscription.

1. Utilization rates can now be predicted based on time of day and location. 
2. Weekday useage is heavily concentrated around the morning and afternoon commute. 
3. Weekend useage is more evenly spread through the day.
